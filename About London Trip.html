		<h1>First Stop: LONDON!</h1>
		<div class="container" >
			<div>This trip all began when a friend and I were having drinks at a bar. She was telling me how she has family in London and it has been years since she last saw them. I instantly pulled out my phone and checked Hopper for flight prices to London. Expecting flights to be over $1000k roundtrip, I was blown away when I found flights as low as $600 each way. I looked at my friend and I said, "Let's do it! Let's go to London and you'll be my tour guide".</div>
			<div>So, that was it...</div>
			<div>A couple of days later we booked the tickets and roughly planned our itinerary. While I never had a "dream" of going to London, I thought I might as well check off all of the generic tourist things of the list. We saw the Tower of London and explored the castle, had drinks on the River Thames, and what ended up being my most favorite part of the trip, visited SALISBURY!</div>
